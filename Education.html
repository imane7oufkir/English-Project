	<div class="container-fluid padding">
<div class="row welcome text-left">
<p>                                                              </p>
	<p>Millions of girls aren't at school today. They are shut out of education because of discrimination,
		poverty, emergencies and culture. These girls have the
		same hopes and dreams as boys. They want to learn,
		fulfil their potential, work and help their families
		and communities.But too often they are treated as second-class.
		They are exploited, abused and simply disregarded in many countries.</p>

	<p>Figures from UNICEF last year showed that about 32 million girls
		of primary school age and 29 million of lower secondary school
		age are not getting an education. But a new index published by
		the ONE Campaign put the number of girls not in school in any
		age group at 130 million.</p>
	<p>On International Day of the Girl Child, there are 13 reasons why girls
		continue to be denied an education , here are somme of these reasons :</p>
	<ul>
		<p><mark>Early mariage :</mark> Too often marriage is seen as a higher priority than education. The low value attached to girls’ schooling means few other options are available to them.
Boys can be affected but most victims of child marriage are girls. It is estimated that every year 15 million girls are married before they turn 18. After their wedding they leave the education system and, because they have fewer educational skills, they and their families are more likely to live in poverty.
There are child marriages in every part of the world, including Europe and north America. But the highest rates of girls under 18 getting married are in Niger (76%), Central African Republic and Chad (both 68%).
 </p>
		<p>                                                              </p>
		<p> <mark>Pregnency : </mark>In many parts of the world, girls who are pregnant - regardless of their circumstances - will be excluded from school.
Many do not return after giving birth due to those rules, stigma, fees, lack of childcare and the unavailability of flexible school programmes.
About 16 million girls aged 15 to 19 and some one million girls under 15 give birth every year—most in low- and middle-income countries, according to the World Health Organization.
</p>
		<p> <mark>Violence at school : </mark>Not only is this a violation of their human rights, it is also one of the most common causes for girls to drop out of school.
An estimated 246 million girls and boys are harassed and abused on their way to and at school every year - with girls particularly vulnerable. In Africa, half of all children said they had been bullied at school.
18 million girls aged 15 to 19 are victims of sexual violence - often leading to school dropout and reinforcing cultural practices such as early marriage.
</p>
		<p>                                                              </p>
		<p> <mark>Lack of funding :</mark>Funding is an important issue when looking at reasons why girls aren’t in school. Education for girls is often the lowest budget priority in many countries.
Daughters are perceived to be less valuable once educated, and less likely to abide by the will of the father, brother or husband. Often male siblings will be given the chance to attend school instead.
But educating girls and young women increases a country's productivity and contributes to economic growth. Some countries lose more than $1 billion a year by failing to educate girls to the same level as boys.
</p>
			<p> <mark>Child/domestic labour : </mark>Girls often stay home to take care of younger siblings and bear the main burden of housework. While educating a boy is considered a sound investment, it is sometimes considered to be a waste of time for girls.
Many girls begin working as early as five years old - mainly in agriculture or in homes as domestic servants. Child domestic workers are particularly vulnerable to trafficking, forced labour, sexual violence and many health issues.
There are more than 168 million child labourers - 11% of all children in the world - who are working instead of learning. There are significantly more girls than boys working in service industries.

	<p>Gender discrimination may seem like a minor problem, but the truth is that it increases conflict and tension among classmates.</p>
	<p>Another effect of gender discrimination is that girls will feel less motivated to do their homework, because they don’t feel valued by their environement. This can hinder productivity of girls students.</p>
	<p>Damaged Morale, A hostile environment can lower the morale of girls directly affected.</p>
	<p>As a result some girls prefer dropping out from school,
		They give up their dreams and goals in life only because society
		did not appreciate them.</p>

<p><mark>Promote a culture of meritocracy : </mark>	the teacher has to accept ideas come from all levels, genders and races and all voices.
   We can't have equality at until we have equality at home. society should adopt more innovative parental leave models that encourage girls , to fight more for their dreams like men.
   Be transparent in behaviour with each gender.
	Give girls more chance to go to school, educate, and get more degrees. </p>

<p> One in ten primary schoolgirls reported being unhappy being a girl, doubling to one in five by the time they reach secondary school. This contrasts with less than 1% of boys at primary school and less than 3% of boys at secondary school.</p>
<p>33,000 girls around the world dropp out from school to become child brides every day.

   In low-income countries, for every hundred boys who continue their education after high school, only fifty-five girls do the same.

	<p>In rural areas of Morocco, on average only 57.8% of young girls have access to secondary education and less than one in five continue their education into high school. </p>
	<p>One great problem is the failure of many students to pass their exams; they lack the support they need to reach the level of education required to pass. Another factor contributing to the drop-out rate is the lack of extra-curricula activities in public schools.</p>
	<p>In 2009 the National Education Ministry launched an emergency plan
		to tackle this problem. They have been training more professors,
		who remain critically undervalued, and trying to better the quality of life at school with extra-curricula activities. But the volume of school drop-outs remains alarmingly high. Neither the national education system nor the environment in which school-age children are developing provide the knowledge or crucial life skills necessary for children to grow up into responsible adults and citizens of the future.</p>

	<p class="lead">Jamila is a 12-year-old girl living in rural Morocco. She is still in school when most girls her age are not—about 78 percent of girls between the ages of 12 and 14 are no longer in formal schooling in the country’s rural areas. Her dream is to become a doctor, and if she stays on track with her education she should be able to accomplish this goal.
 </p>
	<p class="lead">But significant challenges stand in Jamila’s way—a slowing economy over the past five years, limited job opportunities (22 percent youth unemployment), and fewer women in the workplace as compared to men (25 percent participation rate compared to over 66 percent).</p>
	<p class="lead">The government has started to implement policies that better integrate women into the economy, but more still needs to be done to help young girls like Jamila achieve their dreams. </p>

	<p>To change this, W4’s field program in Morocco, Art dans le Jardin, provides adolescent girls from disadvantaged backgrounds with training for personal development. The girls are empowered to discover their personalities, their desires and their motivations through drama.</p>
	<p>                                                              </p>
	<p>For instance, our study found that:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Entrepreneurs and professionals provide educational and vocational guidance while also giving the girls insights into the working world. Each professional mentors two girls and follows and contributes to their personal and professional development for the duration of their studies.</li>
			<p>                                                              </p>
		<li>The program also helps the students to create CV videos for themselves. Activities like this provide them with the opportunity to think about their strengths and weaknesses and who they are, in addition to equipping them with a useful resource for the future.</li>
