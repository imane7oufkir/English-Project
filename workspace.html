		<p class="lead"> Workplace gender discrimination comes in many different forms, but generally it means that an employee or a job applicant is treated differently or less favorably because of their sex or gender, or because the person is affiliated with an organization or group that is associated with a particular sex or gender.  </p>

<div class="col-12">
		<p class="lead"> So many times employees and especially women face different forms of discrimination.  These are some examples of treatment that could be gender discrimination include:
		</p>
		<ul>
 			 <li>Not being hired, or being given a lower-paying position because of your sex (for example, when an employer refuses to hire women, or only hires women for certain jobs).</li>
			 <li>Being held to different or higher standards, or being evaluated more harshly, because of your sex, or because you don’t act or present yourself in a way that conforms to traditional ideas of femininity or masculinity.</li>
			 <li>Being paid less than a person of a different sex who is similarly or less qualified than you, or who has similar (or fewer) job duties than you.</li>
			 <li>Being denied a promotion, pay raise, or training opportunity that is given to people of another sex who are equally or less qualified or eligible as you. </li>
			 <li>Being written up or disciplined for something that other employees of a different sex do all the time but never get punished for.</li>
			 <li>Being insulted, called derogatory names or slurs because of your sex, or hearing hostile remarks about people of a certain sex, gender, or gender identity.</li>

	<div class="row welcome text-left">
<div class="col-12">
		<p class="lead"> There is gender imbalance in the workplace, and women who report that their workplace has more men than women have a very different set of experiences than their counterparts in work settings that are mostly female or have an even mix of men and women.

	<p>                                                              </p>
	 <p>A plurality of women (48%) say they work in places where there are more women than men, while 18% say there are more men than women, according to a Pew Research Center survey. Similarly, 44% of men say their workplace is majority-male, and 19% say women outnumber men. About a third of women (33%) and men (36%) say both genders are about equally represented in their workplace.</p>
	<p>The survey – conducted in 2017, prior to the recent outcry about sexual harassment by men in prominent positions – found that women employed in majority-male workplaces are more likely to say their gender has made it harder for them to get ahead at work, they are less likely to say women are treated fairly in personnel matters, and they report experiencing gender discrimination at significantly higher rates.</p>
	<p>In addition, while about half of women who say their workplace is mostly male (49%) say sexual harassment is a problem where they work, a far smaller share of women who work in mostly female workplaces (32%) say the same.</p>
	<p>Overall, most men (67%) and women (68%) say their gender has not made much of a difference in their job success. But it does make a difference for some workers, and women are about three times as likely as men (19% vs. 7%) to say their gender has made it harder for them to succeed at their job.</p>

		<p class="lead"> If you or someone you know is experiencing or experienced gender discrimination at work, here are some actions you can take.

	<ul>
		<li><mark>Review your employers’ policies :</mark>  Most employers give you an Employment Manual or Handbook when you start. Review this to find out what policies might be in place to protect you. Look for policies about discrimination. Find out what your company’s complaint procedure is, and pay close attention to deadlines

		<li> <mark>Write everything down :</mark>Write down in detail what happened and when it occurred, including anything you said or did, and any witnesses or people that may have been involved in the decisions, policies, or incidents. Include every example of discrimination you can remember. As new things happen, write them down right away so you don’t forget any details. </li>
